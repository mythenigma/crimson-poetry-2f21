## PDF Sharing on Mobile Devices: Why Links Are Way Better Than Files

Here's the thing about mobile users - they HATE downloading files. Seriously. You send someone a PDF attachment, and there's a 70% chance they'll never open it. But send them a link? They'll tap it instantly and read your content right in their browser. Let me show you why mobile PDF sharing is all about links now.

3. **Use clear, readable fonts** - good on small screens
4. **Include navigation aids** - bookmarks, page numbers, contents

**After Creating Links:**
1. **Test on actual mobile devices** - don't just resize browser
2. **Check loading speed** - use mobile network conditions

## The Bottom Line for Mobile PDF Sharing

Mobile users live in a link-based world. They tap, they read, they move on. They don't download, organize files, or manage storage.

Give them what they want: instant access through clean, fast-loading links that work perfectly on their devices.

Your PDF content deserves to be consumed, not ignored because of poor mobile experience.
