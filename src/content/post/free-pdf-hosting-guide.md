## Free PDF Hosting: Best Way to Share Documents Online

Tired of PDF files that are "too big" for email? Fed up with Dropbox links that confuse people? Looking for free PDF hosting that actually works? Here's the thing - most people are using the wrong tools for PDF hosting. Let me show you what actually works in 2025.

## What Is PDF Hosting Anyway?

Think of PDF hosting like YouTube, but for documents instead of videos:
- **Upload your PDF** to a hosting service
- **Get a clean, shareable link** 
- **Anyone can view it** in their browser
- **No downloads required** (unless you want them)
- **Works on any device** with internet

Simple concept, but it solves SO many problems.

## Why You Need PDF Hosting (Not File Sharing)

**Regular File Sharing Problems:**
- Email: "File too large" errors constantly
- Google Drive: Permission nightmares and broken links
- Dropbox: Forces people to create accounts
- WeTransfer: Links expire, downloads are mandatory

**PDF Hosting Solutions:**
- No file size limits for sharing
- Clean, professional links that just work
- No account required for viewers
- Perfect viewing on all devices
- Optional downloads, not mandatory
