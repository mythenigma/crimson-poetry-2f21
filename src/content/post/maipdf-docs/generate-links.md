## Converting PDFs to Secure Links

One of MaiPDF's core features is the ability to transform any PDF document into a secure, shareable link or QR code. This process eliminates the need to send large file attachments while maintaining complete control over access.

## Upload Your PDF

Getting started is simple:

1. **Visit MaiPDF.com** and navigate to the upload section
2. **Drag and drop** your PDF file or click to browse and select
3. **Wait for processing** - our system securely processes your document
4. **Configure settings** before generating your link

## Generate Your Link

Once uploaded, you can:

- **Create a shareable link** that can be sent via email, messaging apps, or embedded in websites
- **Generate a QR code** for easy mobile access or printing on physical materials
- **Customize the link** with memorable names or descriptions

## Security Features

Every generated link comes with built-in security:

- **Unique identifiers** ensure each link is impossible to guess
- **Encryption** protects your document during transmission
- **Access logging** tracks every interaction with your document
- **Expiration controls** automatically disable links when needed

## Best Practices

For optimal security:

- Set appropriate expiration dates for time-sensitive documents
- Use access limits for documents with restricted audiences
- Monitor access logs regularly for unusual activity
- Update permissions as needed, even after sharing
