## Understanding Access Limits

MaiPDF's access limit feature allows you to set precise controls over how many times a document can be opened and for how long it remains accessible during each session.

## Maximum Open Count

Control document access by setting:

- **Single use**: Perfect for confidential documents that should only be viewed once
- **Limited access**: Set a specific number of times the document can be opened
- **Unlimited access**: Allow unrestricted opening within the expiration period

## Reading Duration Controls

Set time-based restrictions:

- **Session timeout**: Automatically close documents after a specified time
- **Total reading time**: Limit the cumulative time spent viewing the document
- **Idle timeout**: Close documents when no activity is detected

## Implementation Examples

### Legal Documents
- **Single viewing** for settlement agreements
- **24-hour access** for contract reviews
- **3-day window** for due diligence materials

### Educational Content
- **Exam duration limits** for timed assessments
- **Study period controls** for course materials
- **Submission deadlines** for assignment access

### Business Documents
- **Meeting duration** for agenda access
- **Presentation timing** for investor materials
- **Review periods** for policy documents

## Dynamic Adjustments

One of MaiPDF's powerful features is the ability to modify access limits even after sharing:

- **Extend deadlines** when more time is needed
- **Reduce access** if circumstances change
- **Monitor usage** and adjust limits based on patterns

## Monitoring and Analytics

Track how limits affect document usage:

- **Access attempt logs** show when limits are reached
- **Usage patterns** help optimize future limit settings
- **Compliance reports** demonstrate adherence to access policies

Configure your access limits thoughtfully to balance security with usability.
