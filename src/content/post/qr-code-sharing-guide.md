### Technical Implementation Guide

**Creating Effective QR Codes**

*Size and Placement Considerations*
```
Minimum QR Code Sizes:
- Business cards: 0.8 x 0.8 inches
- Flyers/posters: 1.5 x 1.5 inches
- Presentations: 2 x 2 inches minimum
- Large displays: 4 x 4 inches or larger
```

*Design Best Practices*
- Use high contrast colors (black on white works best)
- Ensure adequate white space around the code
- Test scanning from typical viewing distances
- Include clear instructions for scanning

*Error Correction Levels*
- **Low (L)**: 7% error correction - use for clean environments
- **Medium (M)**: 15% error correction - standard recommendation
- **Quartile (Q)**: 25% error correction - for challenging conditions
- **High (H)**: 30% error correction - maximum durability

**Security Integration**

*Combining QR Codes with Security Features*
- Email verification before document access
- Time-based expiration for event-specific sharing
- View limits for exclusive or limited content
- Geographic restrictions for location-based events

*Access Control Strategies*
- Generate unique QR codes for different audiences
- Use different security levels for various document types
- Implement tracking to monitor scanning patterns
- Set up notifications for QR code access attempts
