## Generating QR Codes for PDF Links

MaiPDF automatically generates QR codes for every secure PDF link you create, making it easy to share your documents via mobile devices and printed materials.

QR codes provide a convenient way to share PDF links without typing long URLs. Recipients can simply scan the code with their mobile device camera to access your secure PDF with all the protection settings you've configured.

When you create a secure PDF link in MaiPDF, you'll see both the shareable URL and a downloadable QR code in your dashboard, as shown in the result interface.
