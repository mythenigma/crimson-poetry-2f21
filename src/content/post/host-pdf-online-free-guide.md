## What Does "Host PDF Online" Actually Mean?

Think of PDF hosting like having your own mini-website just for documents:

**Traditional Method (Doesn't Work):**
- Email PDF as attachment → "File too large" error
- Save to computer → Recipients can't access it
- USB drive → Only works in person

**Online Hosting Method (Smart):**
- Upload PDF to hosting platform
- Get a web link that anyone can click
- People view your PDF in their browser
- Works on phones, tablets, computers - everything

It's like the difference between mailing someone a book vs telling them where the library is.

## Why Host PDFs Online Instead of Email/Drive?

**Email Problems:**
- Size limits (usually 25MB max)
- Attachments get blocked by spam filters
- Files clog up inboxes
- No way to track who actually read it

**Google Drive/Dropbox Issues:**
- Permission settings confuse people
- "You need access" errors constantly
- Poor mobile viewing experience
- Forces downloads instead of online viewing

**Free PDF Hosting Benefits:**
- No file size limits for viewing
- Clean, professional links
- Perfect mobile experience
- Track who's actually reading
- Update content without new links

- Expensive upgrades

**Reality Check:** Dropbox is built for file storage, not document sharing.
