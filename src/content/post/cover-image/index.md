# MaiPDF Visual Branding Guidelines

This guide demonstrates how to effectively use visual elements, cover images, and branding materials in MaiPDF documentation and marketing content to maintain consistent brand identity across all platforms.

## Cover Image Best Practices

The cover image serves as the first visual impression of your MaiPDF content. It should:

- **Represent the content accurately**: Choose images that reflect the topic being discussed
- **Maintain brand consistency**: Use MaiPDF's color palette and design language
- **Be high quality**: Ensure images are crisp and professional
- **Include relevant context**: Show actual MaiPDF interface elements when applicable

## Visual Identity Standards

### Logo Usage
- Use the official MaiPDF logo in appropriate contexts
- Maintain minimum clear space around the logo
- Ensure proper contrast against background colors
- Never distort or modify the logo proportions

### Color Palette
- **Primary Blue**: Use for headers, links, and primary actions
- **Secondary Gray**: For body text and subtle elements
- **Accent Colors**: For highlights, success states, and warnings
- **Background White**: Clean, professional backdrop for content

### Typography
- **Headers**: Use bold, clear fonts for maximum readability
- **Body Text**: Maintain consistent line height and spacing
- **Code Examples**: Monospace fonts for technical content
- **Captions**: Smaller, italicized text for image descriptions

## Content Integration Examples

### Security Feature Showcases
When documenting security features, include relevant screenshots that show:
- Actual interface elements
- Security settings in action
- User workflow demonstrations
- Results of security configurations
